<p>We're looking forward to improving how students learn in the classroom as we
bring your first-class educational content into schools across the United
States, and to a broader international audience in the future. We'll soon share
more information about Google Play for Education and our services that will help
teachers and administrators buy, deploy, and use apps. </p>

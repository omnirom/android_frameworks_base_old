      <h4>Trusted authentication</h4>
      <p>Google+ Sign-In is a simple, trusted, and secure way to let people sign in
      to your app with their Google credentials and bring along their Google+ info.
      <br />
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/mobile/android/sign-in"
      class="external-link">Add sign-in</a>.</p>

      <h4>Access the profile and social graph</h4>
      <p>Once users have signed in with Google, your app can welcome them by name,
      display their picture, connect them with friends, and lots more.
      <br />
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/mobile/android/people"
      class="external-link">Access the social graph</a>.</p>
       
      <h4>Stand out in the stream</h4>
      <p>Interactive posts is a rich way of sharing to Google+. It lets users prompt friends
      to take specific actions in your app from a Google+ post, like "listen," "RSVP," "check-in,"
      and over 100 more actions. <br />
      <a class="external-link"
      href="https://developers.google.com/+/mobile/android/share">Post interactive content</a>.</p>

      <h4>Recommend content</h4>
      <p>Add a native +1 button so users can recommend content from your app. These endorsements
      can give your app more credibility and help it grow faster.  <br />

    <h4>1. Get the Google Play services SDK</h4>
    <p>The Google+ Android APIs are part of the Google Play services platform.</p>
    <p>To get started, <a href="{@docRoot}google/play-services/setup.html">set up</a>
      the Google Play services SDK.
    </p>
            
    <h4>2. Run the sample</h4>
    <p>Once you've installed the Google Play services package, you can run the Google+ sample located in
    <code>&lt;android-sdk&gt;/extras/google-play-services/samples/plus</code>. However, before
    you can run the sample, you need to register your app in the Google APIs Console.</p>

This directory contains sample code to test system integration with
remote display providers using the API declared by the
com.android.media.remotedisplay.jar library.

--- DESCRIPTION ---

The application registers a service that publishes a few different
remote display routes.  Behavior can be controlled by modifying the
code.

To exercise the provider, use System UI features for connecting to
wireless displays or launch an activity that uses the MediaRouter,
such as the PresentationWithMediaRouterActivity in ApiDemos.

This code is mainly intended for development and not meant to be
used as an example implementation of a robust remote display provider.

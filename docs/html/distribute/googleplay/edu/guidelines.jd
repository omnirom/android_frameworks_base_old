<p>The sections below list the guidelines and requirements for apps
participating in Google Play for Education.

<p>Before you include your app in Google Play for Education, set up a <a
href="#test-environment">test environment</a> and make sure your app meets all
of the safety, usability, and quality guidelines given here. You can use the
linked resources to help
you develop a great app for students that offers compelling content and an
intuitive user experience on Android tablets.</p>

<p>In addition, ensure that your app complies with the terms of a <a
href="https://play.google.com/about/developer-distribution-agreement-addendum.
html" target="_policies">Google Play for Education Addendum</a>, as well as
the standard  <a
href="http://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html"
target="_policies">Google Play Developer Program Policies</a> and <a
href="http://play.google.com/about/developer-distribution-agreement.html"
target="_policies">Developer Distribution Agreement</a>.</p>


<h2 id="requirements">Safety First</h2>

<p>To participate, your apps must be designed to be appropriate for
the K-12 market. The basic requirements that your apps must meet are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Apps and the ads they contain must not collect personally identifiable
information other than user credentials or data required to operate and improve
the app.</li>
  <li>Apps must not use student data for purposes unrelated to its educational
function.</li>
  <li>Apps must have a content rating of "Everyone" or "Low Maturity" (apps with
a "Medium Maturity" rating are allowed, if they have that rating solely because
they allow communication between students).</li>
  <li>App content, including ads displayed by the app, must be consistent with
the app's maturity rating. The app must not display any “offensive” content, as
described in the <a
href="http://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html">Google Play
Developer Program Policies</a> and <a
href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/188189">
content-rating guidelines</a>.</p></li>
<li>Apps must comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
and all other applicable laws and regulations.</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="inapp">Monetizing and Ads</h2>

<p>Google Play for Education provides a simple and secure environment for students
and teachers. To support that environment, priced or free apps that do not use in-app
purchases are preferred, as are apps that do not display ads. Apps that use in-app
payments or ads are acceptable, but you must declare those behaviors when opting-in
to Google Play for Education. Your app's use of in-app purchases or ads will be
disclosed to educators when they are browsing for content.</p>

<p>Follow the guidelines below to help your app receive the
  highest ratings and offer the best possible user-experience.</p>

<p>If your app is priced or sells in-app products, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sell all content and services through Google Play for Education</li>
  <li>Allow Google Play to offer teachers limited free trials before purchase
(through business terms only, no development work is needed)</li>
<li>Disable in-app purchases if possible, or ensure that:

<ul>
<li>Users can access your app's core functionality for a classroom setting without
an in-app purchase.</li>
<li>In-app purchases are clearly identifiable in your UI.</li>
<li>You declare the use of in-app purchases at <a href="{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/edu/start.html#opt-in">opt-in</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In-app
purchases are blocked on Google Play for Education tablets at this time.</p>

<p>If your app displays ads, you should:
  <ul>
  <li>Disable the display of ads if possible, or ensure that:
  <ul>
    <li>Ads are not distracting for students or teachers</li>
    <li>Ads do not occupy a significant portion of the screen</li>
    <li>Ads content does not exceed the maturity rating of the app.</li>
    <li>You declare the use of ads at <a href="{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/edu/start.html#opt-in">opt-in</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h2 id="approved">Educational Value</h2>

<p>Apps submitted to Google Play for Education will be evaluated by a
third-party educator network, which will review them based on alignment with <a
href="http://www.corestandards.org/" class="external-link"
target="_android">Common Core Standards</a> and other factors. This will help
make your content more discoverable for teachers and administrators as they
browse by grade level, subject, core curriculum, and other parameters. </p>

<p>Apps with highest educational value will have these characteristics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Designed for use in K-12 classrooms.</li>
  <li>Aligned with a common core standard or support common-core learning.</li>
  <li>Simple, easy to use, and intuitive for the grade levels the app is targeting.
  App is relatively easy to navigate without teacher guidance. Not distracting
  or overwhelming to students.</li>
  <li>Enjoyable and interactive. App is engaging to students and lets them control
  their experience.</li>
  <li>Versatile. App has features make the it useful for more than one classroom
  function or lesson throughout the school year.</li>
  <li>Supports the "4Cs":
    <ul>
    <li><em>Creativity</em> &mdash; Allows students to create in order to express
    understanding of the learning objectives, and try new approaches, innovation
    and invention to get things done.</li>
    <li><em>Critical thinking</em> &mdash; Allows students to look at problems in
    a new way, linking learning across subjects and disciplines.</li>
    <li><em>Collaboration</em> &mdash; Allows students and (if appropriate) educators
    to work together to reach a goal.</li>
    <li><em>Communication</em> &mdash; Allows students to comprehend, critique and
    share thoughts, questions, ideas and solutions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As you design and develop your app, make sure it offers high educational value
by addressing as many of those characteristics as possible.</p>


<h2 id="quality">App Quality</h2>

<p>Google Play for Education brings educational content to students and teachers
on Android tablets. Your apps should be designed to perform well and look great
on Android tablets, and they should offer the best user experience possible.
</p>

<p>High quality apps are engaging, intuitive, and offer compelling content.
Google Play for Education will highlight high-quality apps for easy discovery in
the store. Here are some recommendations for making your app easy for students
and teachers to enjoy.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Meet Core app quality guidelines
    <ul>
      <li>Follow <a
      href="{@docRoot}design/index.html">Android Design Guidelines</a>. Pay special
      attention to the sections on <a href="{@docRoot}design/patterns/actionbar.html">Action
      Bar</a>, <a href="{@docRoot}design/patterns/navigation.html">Navigation</a> and <a
      href="{@docRoot}design/patterns/pure-android.html">Pure Android</a>.</li>
      <li>Test your apps against the <a href="{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/quality/core.html">Core
      App Quality Guidelines</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<li>Meet tablet app quality guidelines
  <ul>
   <li>Follow our best practices for tablet app development</li>
   <li>Review the <a href="{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/quality/tablet.html">Tablet App
   Quality Checklist</a> and <a
   href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2012/11/designing-for-tablets-were-here-to-help.html"
   target="_android">blog post on designing for tablets</a></li>
   <li>Check your Optimization Tips in the Google Play Developer Console (if you've
   already uploaded your app)</li>
  </ul>
<li>Strive for simplicity and highest usability for students
  <ul>
    <li>Design your app so that teachers and students can use all capabilities of
    your app without having to sign-in to multiple accounts and remember
    multiple passwords.</li>
    <li>Every student or teacher using a Google Play for Education tablet will already be
    signed in with a Google account on the device.  You can take advantage of that to provide a
    simple, seamless sign-in experience in your app. A recommended approach is to use
    <a href="{@docRoot}google/play-services/auth.html">Google OAuth 2 authorization</a>
    through Google Play Services.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="test-environment">Test Environment</h2>

<p>To test your app and assess it against the guidelines in this document, it's
recommended that you set up a test environment that replicates the actual
environment in which students and teachers will run your app.</p>

<p>In general, you should use the test environment described in <a
href="{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/quality/tablet.html#test-environment">
Setting Up a Test Environment for Tablets</a>, including a small number of
actual hardware devices that replicate the tablet form factors used in the
Google Play for Education.</p>

<h3 id="devices">Android tablets</h3>

<p>Google Play for Education uses primarily Nexus 7 devices, so
your testing can focus on that specific hardware device. You can purchase the
device from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_16gb"
target="_android">Google Play</a> and other stores. Although testing on Nexus
devices is preferred, you can test on other 7-inch (or 10-inch) tablets or virtual
devices if you don't have access to Nexus devices.</p>

<h3 id="conditions">Test conditions</h3>

<p>Once you've set up a suitable hardware environment, make sure to test your
apps under conditions that simulate those of schools. For example, Google Play
for Education lets administrators control or disable certain capabilities for
students, so it's good to test your app with those capabilities disabled. Below
are some conditions to test your app in, to ensure best results in the Google
Play for Education environment:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Android version</em> &mdash; Test the app on devices running Android
4.2. Google Play for Education devices will be running Android 4.2 or higher
(API level 17).</li>
<li><em>Proxy server</em> &mdash; Test the app in network environment that uses
proxies. Many schools use proxies.</li>
<li><em>Secondary user account</em> &mdash; Test the app using a secondary user
account. Most Google Play for Education users will not be using the primary <a
href="{@docRoot}about/versions/jelly-bean.html#42-multiuser">multiuser</a>
account on their devices. For testing, create a secondary multiuser account on
your tablet.</li>
<li><em>No location services</em> &mdash; Test the app to make sure it works
properly with location services disabled. Many schools will disable location
services for student devices.</li>
<li><em>No In-app Billing</em> &mdash; Test the app to make sure it works
properly without access to In-app Billing. In-app purchases are blocked on
Google Play for Education devices at this time.</li>
<li><em>No Bluetooth</em> &mdash; Test the app to make sure it works properly
when Bluetooth is disabled. Many schools will disable Bluetooth on student
devices.</li>
<li><em>No access to network</em> &mdash; Test the app to make sure it works
properly when the device cannot connect to the internet. </li>
</ul>

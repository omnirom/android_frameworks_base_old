<p>When developing your Android application to take advantage of multiple APKs on Google Play,
it’s important to adopt some good practices from the get-go, and prevent unnecessary headaches
further into the development process.  This lesson shows you how to create multiple APKs of your
app, each covering a slightly different range of API levels.  You will also gain some tools
necessary to make maintaining a multiple APK codebase as painless as possible.</p>


<h2 id="Confirm">Confirm You Need Multiple APKs</h2>

<p>When trying to create an application that works across multiple generations of the Android
platform, naturally you want your application to take advantage of new features on new devices,
without sacrificing backwards compatibility.  It may seem at the outset as though multiple APK
support is the best solution, but this often isn’t the case.  The <a
href="{@docRoot}google/play/publishing/multiple-apks.html#ApiLevelOptions">Using Single APK
Instead</a> section of the multiple APK developer guide includes some useful information on how to
accomplish this with a single APK, including use of our support library. You can also learn how to
write code that runs only at certain API levels in a single APK, without resorting to
computationally expensive techniques like reflection from  <a
href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/07/how-to-have-your-cupcake-and-eat-it-too.html">
this article</a>.</p>

<p>If you can manage it, confining your application to a single APK has several
advantages, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Publishing and testing are easier</li>
<li>There’s only one codebase to maintain</li>
<li>Your application can adapt to device configuration changes</li>
<li>App restore across devices just works</li>
<li>You don’t have to worry about market preference, behavior from "upgrades" from one APK to the
next, or which APK goes with which class of devices
</ul>

<p>The rest of this lesson assumes that you’ve researched the topic, studiously absorbed the
material in the resources linked, and determined that multiple APKs are the right path for your
application.</p>

<h2 id="ChartReqs">Chart Your Requirements</h2>

<p>Start off by creating a simple chart to quickly determine how many APKs you need, and what API
range each APK covers.  For handy reference, the <a
href="{@docRoot}about/dashboards/index.html">Platform Versions</a> page of the
Android Developer website provides data about the relative number of active devices running a given
version of the Android platform.  Also, although it sounds easy at first, keeping track of which set
of API levels each APK is going to target gets difficult rather quickly, especially if there’s going
to be some overlap (there often is).  Fortunately, it’s easy to chart out your requirements quickly,
easily, and have an easy reference for later.</p>

<p>In order to create your multiple APK chart, start out with a row of cells representing the
various API levels of the Android platform.  Throw an extra cell at the end to represent future
versions of Android.</p>
<table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>11</td>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>13</td>
      <td>+</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Now just color in the chart such that each color represents an APK.  Here’s one example of how
you might apply each APK to a certain range of API levels.</p>

<table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="blueCell">3</td>
      <td class="blueCell">4</td>
      <td class="blueCell">5</td>
      <td class="blueCell">6</td>
      <td class="greenCell">7</td>
      <td class="greenCell">8</td>
      <td class="greenCell">9</td>
      <td class="greenCell">10</td>
      <td class="redCell">11</td>
      <td class="redCell">12</td>
      <td class="redCell">13</td>
      <td class="redCell">+</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Once you’ve created this chart, distribute it to your team.  Team communication on your project
just got immediately simpler, since instead of asking "How’s the APK for API levels 3 to 6, er, you
know, the Android 1.x one.  How’s that coming along?"  You can simply say "How’s the Blue APK coming
along?"</p>

<h2 id="CreateLibrary">Put All Common Code and Resources in a Library Project</h2>
<p>Whether you’re modifying an existing Android application or starting one from scratch, this is
the first thing that you should do to the codebase, and by the far the most important.  Everything
that goes into the library project only needs to be updated once (think language-localized strings,
color themes, bugs fixed in shared code), which improves your development time and reduces the
likelihood of mistakes that could have been easily avoided.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>  While the implementation details of how to create and
include library projects are beyond the scope of this lesson, you can get up to speed quickly on
their creation at the following links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="{@docRoot}tools/projects/projects-eclipse.html#SettingUpLibraryProject">Setting up
a library project (Eclipse)</a></li>
<li><a
href="{@docRoot}tools/projects/projects-cmdline.html#SettingUpLibraryProject">Setting up
a library project (Command line)</a></li>
</ul>


<p>If you’re converting an existing application to use multiple APK support,
scour your codebase for every localized string file, list of values, theme
colors, menu icons and layout that isn’t going to change across APKs, and put
it all in the library project.  Code that isn’t going to change much should
also go in the library project.  You’ll likely find yourself extending these
classes to add a method or two from APK to APK.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you’re creating the application from scratch, try as
much as possible to write code in the library project <em>first</em>, then only move it down to an
individual APK if necessary.  This is much easier to manage in the long run than adding it to one,
then another, then another, then months later trying to figure out whether this blob can be moved up
to the library section without screwing anything up.</p>

<h2 id="CreateAPKs">Create New APK Projects</h2>
<p>There should be a separate Android project for each APK you’re going to release.  For easy
organization, place the library project and all related APK projects under the same parent folder. 
Also remember that each APK needs to have the same package name, although they don’t necessarily
need to share the package name with the library.  If you were to have 3 APKs following the scheme
described earlier, your root directory might look like this:</p>

<pre class="no-pretty-print classic">
alexlucas:~/code/multi-apks-root$ ls
foo-blue
foo-green
foo-lib
foo-red
</pre>

<p>Once the projects are created, add the library project as a reference to each APK project.  If
possible, define your starting Activity in the library project, and extend that Activity in your APK
project.  Having a starting activity defined in the library project gives you a chance to put all
your application initialization in one place, so that each individual APK doesn’t have to
re-implement "universal" tasks like initializing Analytics, running licensing checks, and any other
initialization procedures that don’t change much from APK to APK.</p>


<h2 id="AdjustManifests">Adjust the Manifests</h2>
<p>When a user downloads an application which uses multiple APKs through Google Play, the correct
APK to use is chosen using two simple rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>The manifest has to show that particular APK is eligible</li>
<li>Of the eligible APKs, highest version number wins</li>
</ul>
<p>
By way of example, let’s take the set of multiple APKs described earlier, and assume that we haven’t
set a max API level for any of the APKs.  Taken individually, the possible range of each APK would
look like this:</p>
<table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="blueCell">3</td>
      <td class="blueCell">4</td>
      <td class="blueCell">5</td>
      <td class="blueCell">6</td>
      <td class="blueCell">7</td>
      <td class="blueCell">8</td>
      <td class="blueCell">9</td>
      <td class="blueCell">10</td>
      <td class="blueCell">11</td>
      <td class="blueCell">12</td>
      <td class="blueCell">13</td>
      <td class="blueCell">+</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blackCell">3</td>
      <td class="blackCell">4</td>
      <td class="blackCell">5</td>
      <td class="blackCell">6</td>
      <td class="greenCell">7</td>
      <td class="greenCell">8</td>
      <td class="greenCell">9</td>
      <td class="greenCell">10</td>
      <td class="greenCell">11</td>
      <td class="greenCell">12</td>
      <td class="greenCell">13</td>
      <td class="greenCell">+</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blackCell">3</td>
      <td class="blackCell">4</td>
      <td class="blackCell">5</td>
      <td class="blackCell">6</td>
      <td class="blackCell">7</td>
      <td class="blackCell">8</td>
      <td class="blackCell">9</td>
      <td class="blackCell">10</td>
      <td class="redCell">11</td>
      <td class="redCell">12</td>
      <td class="redCell">13</td>
      <td class="redCell">+</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
Because it is required that an APK with a higher minSdkVersion also have a
higher version code, we know that in terms of versionCode values, red &#8805;
green &#8805; blue.  Therefore we can effectively collapse the chart to look like this:</p>
<table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="blueCell">3</td>
      <td class="blueCell">4</td>
      <td class="blueCell">5</td>
      <td class="blueCell">6</td>
      <td class="greenCell">7</td>
      <td class="greenCell">8</td>
      <td class="greenCell">9</td>
      <td class="greenCell">10</td>
      <td class="redCell">11</td>
      <td class="redCell">12</td>
      <td class="redCell">13</td>
      <td class="redCell">+</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
Now, let’s further assume that the Red APK has some requirement on it that the other two don’t.  
<a href="{@docRoot}google/play/filters.html">Filters on Google Play</a> page of
the Android Developer guide has a whole list of possible culprits.  For the
sake of example, let’s assume that red requires a front-facing camera.  In fact, the entire point of
the red APK is to combine the front-facing camera with sweet new functionality that was added in API
11.  But, it turns out, not all devices that support API 11 even HAVE front-facing cameras!  The
horror!</p>

<p>Fortunately, if a user is browsing Google Play from one such device, Google Play will look at the
manifest, see that Red lists the front-facing camera as a requirement, and quietly ignore it, having
determined that Red and that device are not a match made in digital heaven.  It will then see that
Green is not only forward-compatible with devices with API 11 (since no maxSdkVersion was defined),
but also doesn’t care whether or not there’s a front-facing camera!  The app can still be downloaded
from Google Play by the user, because despite the whole front-camera mishap, there was still an
APK that supported that particular API level.</p>

<p>  In order to keep all your APKs on separate "tracks", it’s important to have a good version code
scheme.  The recommended one can be found on the <a
href="{@docRoot}google/play/publishing/multiple-apks.html#VersionCodes">Version Codes</a> area of
our developer guide.  Since the example set of APKs is only dealing with one of 3 possible
dimensions, it would be sufficient to separate each APK by 1000, set the first couple digits to the
minSdkVersion for that particular APK, and increment from there.  This might look like:</p>

<p>Blue: 03001, 03002, 03003, 03004...<br />
Green: 07001, 07002, 07003, 07004...<br />
Red:11001, 11002, 11003, 11004...</p>

<p>  Putting this all together, your Android Manifests would likely look something like the following:</p>
<p>Blue:</p>
<pre>
&lt;manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:versionCode="03001" android:versionName="1.0" package="com.example.foo"&gt;
    &lt;uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="3" /&gt;
    ...
</pre>

<p>Green:</p>
<pre>
&lt;manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:versionCode="07001" android:versionName="1.0" package="com.example.foo"&gt;
    &lt;uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="7" /&gt;
    ...
</pre>

<p>Red:</p>
<pre>
&lt;manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:versionCode="11001" android:versionName="1.0" package="com.example.foo"&gt;
    &lt;uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="11" /&gt;
    ...
</pre>

<h2 id="PreLaunch">Go Over Pre-launch Checklist</h2>
<p>  Before uploading to Google Play, double-check the following items.  Remember that these are specifically relevant to multiple APKs, and in no way represent a complete checklist for all applications being uploaded to Google Play.</p>

<ul>
<li>All APKs must have the same package name</li>
<li>All APKs must be signed with the same certificate</li>
<li>If the APKs overlap in platform version, the one with the higher minSdkVersion must have a higher version code</li>
<li>Double check your manifest filters for conflicting information (an APK that only supports cupcake on XLARGE screens isn’t going to be seen by anybody)</li>
<li>Each APK's manifest must be unique across at least one of supported screen, openGL texture, or platform version</li>
<li>Try to test each APK on at least one device.  Barring that, you have one of the most customizable device emulators in the business sitting on your development machine.  Go nuts!</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s also worth inspecting the compiled APK before pushing to market, to make sure there aren’t
any surprises that could hide your application on Google Play.  This is actually quite simple using the
"aapt" tool.  Aapt (the Android Asset Packaging Tool) is part of the build process for creating and
packaging your Android applications, and is also a very handy tool for inspecting them. </p>

<pre class="no-pretty-print classic">
&gt;aapt dump badging
package: name='com.example.hello' versionCode='1' versionName='1.0'
sdkVersion:'11'
uses-permission:'android.permission.SEND_SMS'
application-label:'Hello'
application-icon-120:'res/drawable-ldpi/icon.png'
application-icon-160:'res/drawable-mdpi/icon.png'
application-icon-240:'res/drawable-hdpi/icon.png'
application: label='Hello' icon='res/drawable-mdpi/icon.png'
launchable-activity: name='com.example.hello.HelloActivity'  label='Hello' icon=''
uses-feature:'android.hardware.telephony'
uses-feature:'android.hardware.touchscreen'
main
supports-screens: 'small' 'normal' 'large' 'xlarge'
supports-any-density: 'true'
locales: '--_--'
densities: '120' '160' '240'
</pre>

<p>When you examine aapt output, be sure to check that you don’t have conflicting values for
supports-screens and compatible-screens, and that you don’t have unintended "uses-feature" values
that were added as a result of permissions you set in the manifest. In the example above, the APK
won’t be visible to very many devices.</p>
<p>Why?  By adding the required permission SEND_SMS, the feature requirement of android.hardware.telephony was implicitly added.  Since API 11 is Honeycomb (the version of Android optimized specifically for tablets), and no Honeycomb devices have telephony hardware in them, Google Play will filter out this APK in all cases, until future devices come along which are higher in API level AND possess telephony hardware.
</p>
<p>Fortunately this is easily fixed by adding the following to your manifest:</p>
<pre>
&lt;uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.telephony" android:required="false" /&gt;
</pre>
<p>The <code>android.hardware.touchscreen</code> requirement is also implicitly added. If you want your APK to be visible on TVs which are non-touchscreen devices you should add the following to your manifest:</p>
<pre>
&lt;uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.touchscreen" android:required="false" /&gt;
</pre>
<p>Once you’ve completed the pre-launch checklist, upload your APKs to Google Play.  It may take a bit for the application to show up when browsing Google Play, but when it does, perform one last check.  Download the application onto any test devices you may have, to make sure that the APKs are targeting the intended devices.  Congratulations, you’re done!</p>

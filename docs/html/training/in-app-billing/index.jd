<p>In this class, you'll learn how to perform common In-app Billing operations from Android applications.</p>
<p>In-app billing is a service hosted on Google Play that lets you charge for digital content or for upgrades in your app.  The In-app Billing API makes it easy for you to integrate In-app Billing into your applications. You can request product details from Google Play, issue orders for in-app products, and quickly retrieve ownership information based on users' purchase history. You can also query the Google Play service for details about in-app products, such as local pricing and availability. Google Play provides a checkout interface that makes user interactions with the In-app Billing service seamless, and provides a more intuitive experience to your users.</p>
<p>This class describes how to get started with the Version 3 API. To learn how to use the version 2 API, see <a href="{@docRoot}google/play/billing/v2/billing_integrate.html">Implementing In-App Billing (V2)</a>.</p>

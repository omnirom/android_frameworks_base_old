<p>Android devices come in many shapes and sizes all around the world. With a wide range of device
types, you have an opportunity to reach a huge audience with your app. In order to be as successful
as possible on Android, your app needs to adapt to various device configurations. Some of the
important variations that you should consider include different languages, screen sizes, and
versions of the Android platform.</p>

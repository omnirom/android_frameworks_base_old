<p>App quality directly influences the long-term success of your app&mdash;in
terms of installs, user rating and reviews, engagement, and user retention.
Android users expect high-quality apps, even more so if they've spent money on
them.</p>

<p>This document helps you assess basic aspects of quality in your app through a
compact set of <em>core app quality criteria</em> and associated tests. All
Android apps should meet these criteria.</p>

<p>Before publishing your app, make sure to test it against these criteria to
ensure that it functions well on many devices, meets Android standards for
navigation and design, and is prepared for promotional opportunities in the
Google Play Store. Your testing will go well beyond what's described here&mdash;the
purpose of this document is to specify the essential characteristics
of basic quality so that you can include them in your test plans.</p>

<p>If your app is targeting tablet devices, make sure that it delivers a rich,
compelling experience to your tablet customers. See the <a
href="{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/quality/tablet.html">Tablet App Quality
Checklist</a> for recommendations on ways to optimize your app for tablets.</p>


<h2 id="ux">Visual Design and User Interaction</h2>

<p>These criteria ensure that your app provides standard Android visual design
and interaction patterns where appropriate, for a consistent and intuitive
user experience.</p>

<h2 id="ps">Performance and Stability</h2>

<p>To ensure a high user rating, your app needs to perform well and stay
responsive on all of the devices and form factors and screens that it is
targeting. These criteria ensure that the app provides the basic performance,
stability, and responsiveness expected by users.</p>

<h2 id="test-environment">Setting Up a Test Environment</h2>

<p>To assess the quality of your app, you need to set up a suitable
hardware or emulator environment for testing. </p>

<p>The ideal test environment would
include a small number of actual hardware devices that represent key form
factors and hardware/software combinations currently available to consumers.
It's not necessary to test on <em>every</em> device that's on the market &mdash;
rather, you should focus on a small number of representative devices, even using
one or two devices per form factor. </p>

<p>If you are not able to obtain actual hardware devices for testing, you should
<a href="{@docRoot}tools/devices/index.html">set up emulated devices (AVDs)</a>
to represent the most common form factors and
hardware/software combinations.</p>

<p>To go beyond basic testing, you can add more devices, more form factors, or
new hardware/software combinations to your test environment. You can also
increase the number or complexity of tests and quality criteria. </p>


<h2 id="tests">
  Test Procedures
</h2>

<p>These test procedures help you discover various types of quality issues in
your app. You can combine the tests or integrate groups of tests together in
your own test plans. See the sections above for references that associate
specific criteria with specific tests. </p>

Testing with StrictMode
</h3>

<p>For performance testing, we recommend enabling 
{@link android.os.StrictMode} in your app
and using it to catch operations on the main thread and other threads that could
affect performance, network accesses, file reads/writes, and so on.</p>

<p>You can set up a monitoring policy per thread using 
{@link android.os.StrictMode.ThreadPolicy.Builder} and enable all supported monitoring in the
<code>ThreadPolicy</code> using 
{@link android.os.StrictMode.ThreadPolicy.Builder#detectAll()}.</p>

<p>Make sure to enable <strong>visual notification</strong> of policy violations
for the <code>ThreadPolicy</code> using {@link android.os.StrictMode.ThreadPolicy.Builder#penaltyFlashScreen() penaltyFlashScreen()}.</p>

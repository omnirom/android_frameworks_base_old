<BODY>
<p>Provides classes to manage a variety of visual elements that are intended for
display only, such as bitmaps and gradients. These elements are often used
by widgets as background images or simply as indicators (for example, a volume
level indicator).</p>
<p>You can create most of these drawables using XML, as described in <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/resources/drawable-resource.html">Drawable Resources</a>.</p>

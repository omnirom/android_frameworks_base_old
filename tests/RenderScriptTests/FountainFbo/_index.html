<p>An example that renders many dots on the screen that follow a user's touch. The dots fall 
to the bottom of the screen when no touch is detected. This example modifies
the <a href="../Fountain/index.html">Fountain</a> sample to include rendering to a
a framebuffer object as well as the default framebuffer.</p>

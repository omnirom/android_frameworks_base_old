<p>Alarms (based on the {@link android.app.AlarmManager} class) give you a way to perform
time-based operations outside the lifetime of your application.
For example, you could use an alarm to initiate a long-running operation, such
as starting a service once a day to download a weather forecast.</p>

<p>Alarms have these characteristics:</p>
<ul>

<li>They let you fire Intents at set times and/or intervals.</li>

<li>You can use them in conjunction with broadcast receivers to start services and perform
other operations.</li>

<li>They operate outside of your application, so you can use them to trigger events or
actions even when your app is not running, and even if the device itself is asleep.</li>

<li>They help you to minimize your app's resource requirements. You can schedule operations
without relying on timers or continuously running background services.</li>

</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For timing operations that are guaranteed to occur
<em>during</em> the lifetime of your application,
instead consider using the {@link android.os.Handler} class in conjunction with
{@link java.util.Timer} and {@link java.lang.Thread}. This approach gives Android better
control over system resources.</p>

<h2 id="set">Set a Repeating Alarm</h2>

<p>As described above, repeating alarms are a good choice for scheduling regular events or
data lookups. A repeating alarm has the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li>A alarm type. For more discussion, see <a href="#type">Choose an alarm type</a>.</li>
<li>A trigger time. If the trigger time you specify is in the past, the alarm triggers
immediately.</li>
<li>The alarm's interval. For example, once a day, every hour, every 5 seconds, and so on.</li>
<li>A pending intent that fires when the alarm is triggered. When you set a second alarm
that uses the same pending intent, it replaces the original alarm.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every choice you make in designing your repeating alarm can have consequences in how your
app uses (or abuses) system resources. Even a carefully managed alarm can have a major impact
on battery life. Follow these guidelines as you design your app:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep your alarm frequency to a minimum.</li>
<li>Don't wake up the device unnecessarily (this behavior is determined by the alarm type,
as described in <a href="#type">Choose an alarm type</a>).</li>
<li>Don't make your alarm's trigger time any more precise than it has to be:

<ul>
<li>Use {@link android.app.AlarmManager#setInexactRepeating setInexactRepeating()} instead
of {@link android.app.AlarmManager#setRepeating setRepeating()} whenever possible.
When you use {@link android.app.AlarmManager#setInexactRepeating setInexactRepeating()},
Android synchronizes multiple inexact repeating alarms and fires
them at the same time. This reduces the drain on the battery.</li>
<li>If your alarm's behavior is based on an interval (for example, your alarm
fires once an hour) rather than a precise trigger time (for example, your alarm fires at
7 a.m. sharp and every 20 minutes after that), use an {@code ELAPSED_REALTIME}
alarm type.</li>
</ul></li>

</ul>

<h3 id="type">Choose an alarm type</h3>

<p>One of the first considerations in using a repeating alarm is what its type should be.</p>


<p>There are two general clock types for alarms: "elapsed real time" and "real time clock"
(RTC).
Elapsed real time uses the "time since system boot" as a
reference, and real time clock uses UTC (wall clock) time. This means that
elapsed real time is suited to setting an alarm based on the passage of time (for
example, an alarm that fires every 30 seconds) since it isn't affected by
time zone/locale. The real time clock type is better suited for alarms that are dependent
on current locale.</p>

<p>Both types have a "wakeup" version, which says to wake up the device's CPU if the
screen is off. This ensures that the alarm will fire at the scheduled time. This is useful
if your app has a time dependency&mdash;for example, if it has a limited window to perform a
particular operation. If you don't use the wakeup version of your alarm type, then
all the repeating alarms will fire when your device is next awake.</p>

<p>If you simply need your alarm to fire at a particular interval (for example, every half
hour), use one of the elapsed real time types. In general, this is the better choice.</p>

<p>If you need your alarm to fire at a particular time of day,
then choose one of the clock-based real time clock types. Note, however, that this approach can
have some drawbacks&mdash;the app may not translate well to other locales, and if the user
changes the device's time setting, it could cause unexpected behavior in your app.</p>

<p>Here is the list of types:</p>

<ul>

<li>{@link android.app.AlarmManager#ELAPSED_REALTIME}&mdash;Fires the pending intent based
on the amount of time since the  device was booted, but doesn't wake up the device. The
elapsed time includes any time during which the device was asleep.</li>

<li>{@link android.app.AlarmManager#ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP}&mdash;Wakes up the device and
fires the pending intent after the specified length of time has elapsed since device
boot.</li>

<li>{@link android.app.AlarmManager#RTC}&mdash;Fires the pending intent
at the specified time but does not wake up the device.</li>

<li>{@link android.app.AlarmManager#RTC_WAKEUP}&mdash;Wakes up the
device to fire the pending intent at the specified time.</li>
</ul>

<h4>ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP examples</h3>

<p>Here are some examples of using {@link android.app.AlarmManager#ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP}.
</p>

<p>Wake up the device to fire the alarm in 30 minutes, and every 30 minutes
after that:</p>

<pre>
// Hopefully your alarm will have a lower frequency than this!
alarmMgr.setInexactRepeating(AlarmManager.ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP,
        AlarmManager.INTERVAL_HALF_HOUR,
        AlarmManager.INTERVAL_HALF_HOUR, alarmIntent);</pre>

<p>Wake up the device to fire a one-time (non-repeating) alarm in one minute:</p>

<pre>private AlarmManager alarmMgr;
private PendingIntent alarmIntent;
...
alarmMgr = (AlarmManager)context.getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE);
Intent intent = new Intent(context, AlarmReceiver.class);
alarmIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context, 0, intent, 0);

alarmMgr.set(AlarmManager.ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP,
        SystemClock.elapsedRealtime() +
        60 * 1000, alarmIntent);</pre>


<h4>RTC examples</h3>

<p>Here are some examples of using {@link android.app.AlarmManager#RTC_WAKEUP}.</p>

<p>Wake up the device to fire the alarm at approximately 2:00 p.m., and repeat once a day
at the same time:</p>

<pre>// Set the alarm to start at approximately 2:00 p.m.
Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
calendar.setTimeInMillis(System.currentTimeMillis());
calendar.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 14);

// With setInexactRepeating(), you have to use one of the AlarmManager interval
// constants--in this case, AlarmManager.INTERVAL_DAY.
alarmMgr.setInexactRepeating(AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP, calendar.getTimeInMillis(),
        AlarmManager.INTERVAL_DAY, alarmIntent);</pre>

<p>Wake up the device to fire the alarm at precisely 8:30 a.m., and every 20 minutes
thereafter:</p>

<pre>private AlarmManager alarmMgr;
private PendingIntent alarmIntent;
...
alarmMgr = (AlarmManager)context.getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE);
Intent intent = new Intent(context, AlarmReceiver.class);
alarmIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context, 0, intent, 0);

// Set the alarm to start at 8:30 a.m.
Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
calendar.setTimeInMillis(System.currentTimeMillis());
calendar.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 8);
calendar.set(Calendar.MINUTE, 30);

// setRepeating() lets you specify a precise custom interval--in this case,
// 20 minutes.
alarmMgr.setRepeating(AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP, calendar.getTimeInMillis(),
        1000 * 60 * 20, alarmIntent);</pre>

<h3>Decide how precise your alarm needs to be</h3>

<p>As described above, choosing the alarm type is often the first step in creating an alarm.
A further distinction is how precise you need your alarm to be. For most apps,
{@link android.app.AlarmManager#setInexactRepeating setInexactRepeating()} is the right
choice.
When you use this method, Android synchronizes multiple inexact repeating alarms and fires
them at the same time. This reduces the drain on the battery.</p>

<p>For the rare app that has rigid time requirements&mdash;for example, the alarm needs to
fire precisely at 8:30 a.m., and every hour on the hour
thereafter&mdash;use {@link android.app.AlarmManager#setRepeating setRepeating()}. But you
should avoid using exact alarms if possible.</p>

<p>With {@link android.app.AlarmManager#setInexactRepeating setInexactRepeating()},
you can't specify a custom interval the way you can with
{@link android.app.AlarmManager#setRepeating setRepeating()}. You have to use one of the
interval constants, such as {@link android.app.AlarmManager#INTERVAL_FIFTEEN_MINUTES},
{@link android.app.AlarmManager#INTERVAL_DAY}, and so on. See {@link android.app.AlarmManager}
for the complete list.
</p>

<h2 id="cancel">Cancel an Alarm</h2>

<p>Depending on your app, you may want to include the ability to cancel the alarm.
To cancel an alarm, call {@link android.app.AlarmManager#cancel cancel()} on the Alarm
Manager, passing in the {@link android.app.PendingIntent} you no longer want to fire. For
example:</p>

<pre>// If the alarm has been set, cancel it.
if (alarmMgr!= null) {
    alarmMgr.cancel(alarmIntent);
}</pre>

<h2 id="boot">Start an Alarm When the Device Boots</h2>

<p>By default, all alarms are canceled when a device shuts down.
To prevent this from happening, you can design your application
to automatically restart a repeating alarm if the user reboots the device. This ensures
that the {@link android.app.AlarmManager} will continue doing its task without the user
needing to manually restart the alarm.</p>


<p>Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the <a href="{@docRoot}reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED">
{@code RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED}</a> permission in your application's manifest. This allows
your app to receive the
{@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED} that is broadcast after the system
finishes booting (this only works if the app has already been launched by the user at least once):
<pre>
&lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED&quot;/&gt;</pre>
</li>

<li>Implement a {@link android.content.BroadcastReceiver} to receive the broadcast:
<pre>public class SampleBootReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {

    &#64;Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        if (intent.getAction().equals(&quot;android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED&quot;)) {
            // Set the alarm here.
        }
    }
}</pre></li>

<li>Add the receiver to your app's manifest file with an intent filter that filters on
the {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED} action:

<pre>&lt;receiver android:name=&quot;.SampleBootReceiver&quot;
        android:enabled=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
    &lt;intent-filter&gt;
        &lt;action android:name=&quot;android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED&quot;&gt;&lt;/action&gt;
    &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
&lt;/receiver&gt;</pre>


<p>Notice that in the manifest, the boot receiver is set to
{@code android:enabled=&quot;false&quot;}. This means that the receiver will not be called
unless the application explicitly enables it. This prevents the boot receiver from being
called unnecessarily. You can enable a receiver (for example, if the user sets an alarm)
as follows:</p>

<pre>ComponentName receiver = new ComponentName(context, SampleBootReceiver.class);
PackageManager pm = context.getPackageManager();

pm.setComponentEnabledSetting(receiver,
        PackageManager.COMPONENT_ENABLED_STATE_ENABLED,
        PackageManager.DONT_KILL_APP);
</pre>

<p>Once you enable the receiver this way, it will stay enabled, even if the user reboots
the device. In other words, programmatically enabling the receiver overrides the
manifest setting, even across reboots. The receiver will stay enabled until your app disables it.
You can disable a receiver (for example, if the user cancels an alarm) as follows:</p>

<pre>ComponentName receiver = new ComponentName(context, SampleBootReceiver.class);
PackageManager pm = context.getPackageManager();

pm.setComponentEnabledSetting(receiver,
        PackageManager.COMPONENT_ENABLED_STATE_DISABLED,
        PackageManager.DONT_KILL_APP);</pre>

</li>
</ol>

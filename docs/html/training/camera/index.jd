<p>The world was a dismal and featureless place before rich media became
prevalent. Remember Gopher? We don't, either. For your app to become
part of your users' lives, give them a way to put their lives into it.
Using the on-board cameras, your application can enable users to augment what
they see around them, make unique avatars, look for zombies around the corner,
or simply share their experiences.</p>

<p>This class gets you clicking fast with some super-easy ways of
leveraging existing camera applications. In later lessons, you dive deeper
and learn how to control the camera hardware directly.</p>

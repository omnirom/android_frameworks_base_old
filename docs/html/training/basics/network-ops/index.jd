<p>This class explains the basic tasks involved in connecting to the network,
monitoring the network connection (including connection changes), and giving
users control over an app's network usage. It also describes how to parse and
consume XML data.</p> 

<p>This class includes a sample application that illustrates how to perform
common network operations. You can download the sample (to the right) and use it
as a source of reusable code for your own application.</p>

<p>By going through these lessons, you'll have the
fundamental building blocks for creating Android applications that download
content and parse data efficiently, while minimizing network traffic.</p>

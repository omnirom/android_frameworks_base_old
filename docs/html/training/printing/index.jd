<p>
  Android users frequently view content solely on their devices, but there are times when
  showing someone a screen is not an adequate way to share information. Being able to print
  information from your Android application gives users a way to see a larger version of the
  content from your app or share it with another person who is not using your application.
  Printing also allows them to create a snapshot of information that does not depend on having a
  device, sufficient battery power, or a wireless network connection.

  In Android 4.4 (API level 19) and higher, the framework provides services for printing images and
  documents directly from Android applications. This training describes how to enable printing in
  your application, including printing images, HTML pages and creating custom documents for
  printing.

page.title=Adding Platforms and Packages

@jd:body


<p>The Android SDK separates tools, platforms, and other components into packages you can
  download using the Android SDK Manager. The original
SDK package you've downloaded includes only the SDK Tools. To develop an Android app,
you also need to download at least one Android platform and the latest SDK Platform-tools.</p>

<ol>
<li>Launch the SDK Manager.
<p>If you've used the Windows installer to install the SDK tools, you should already have the
Android SDK Manager open. Otherwise, you can launch the Android SDK Manager in one of the following
ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On Windows, double-click the <code>SDK Manager.exe</code> file at the root of the Android
SDK directory.</li>
  <li>On Mac or Linux, open a terminal and navigate to the <code>tools/</code> directory in the
Android SDK, then execute <code>android sdk</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>The SDK Manager shows all the SDK packages available for you to add to your Android SDK.
As a minimum configuration for your SDK, we recommend you install the following:
<ul>
 <li>The latest Tools packages (check the <strong>Tools</strong> folder).</li>
 <li>The latest version of Android (check the first <strong>Android</strong> folder).</li>
 <li>The Android Support Library (open the <strong>Extras</strong> folder and check
  <strong>Android Support Library</strong>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you've chosen your packages, click <strong>Install</strong>. The Android SDK Manager
installs the selected packages into your Android SDK environment.</li>
</ol>

<p>With these packages installed, you're ready to start developing.
To get started, read <a href="{@docRoot}training/basics/firstapp/index.html"

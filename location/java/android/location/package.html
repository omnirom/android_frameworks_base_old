<p>Contains the framework API classes that define Android location-based and related services.</p>
<p class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong> The Google Location Services API, part of Google Play
    Services, provides a more powerful, high-level framework that automates tasks such as
    location provider choice and power management. Location Services also provides new
    features such as activity detection that aren't available in the framework API. Developers who
    are using the framework API, as well as developers who are just now adding location-awareness
    to their apps, should strongly consider using the Location Services API.

<p><em>In this exercise, you will use the debugger to look at the work you did
in Exercise 3. This exercise demonstrates:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>How to set breakpoints to observe execution</em> </li>
<li><em>How to run your application in debug mode</code></em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1</h2>

<p>Using the working <code>Notepadv3</code>, put breakpoints in the code at the
    beginning of the <code>onCreate()</code>, <code>onPause()</code>,
    <code>onSaveInstanceState()</code> and <code>onResume()</code> methods in the
    <code>NoteEdit</code> class (if you are not familiar with Eclipse, just
    right click in the narrow grey border on the left of the edit window at the
    line you want a breakpoint, and select <em>Toggle Breakpoint</em>, you
should see a blue dot appear).</p>
 
<h2>Step 2</h2>

<p>Now start the notepad demo in debug mode:</p>

<ol type="a">
    <li>
      Right click on the <code>Notepadv3</code> project and from the Debug menu
      select <em>Debug As -&gt; Android Application.</em></li>
    <li>
      The Android emulator should say <em>"waiting for debugger to connect"</em>
      briefly and then run the application.</li>
  <li>
      If it gets stuck on the waiting... screen, quit the emulator and Eclipse,
      from the command line do an <code>adb kill-server</code>, and then restart
Eclipse and try again.</li></ol>
      
      <h2>Step 3</h2>

<p>When you edit or create a new note you should see the breakpoints getting
    hit and the execution stopping.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 4</h2>

<p>Hit the Resume button to let execution continue (yellow rectangle with a
green triangle to its right in the Eclipse toolbars near the top).</p>

<h2>Step 5</h2>

<p>Experiment a bit with the confirm and back buttons, and try pressing Home and
    making other mode changes. Watch what life-cycle events are generated and
when.</p>

<p>The Android Eclipse plugin not only offers excellent debugging support for
your application development, but also superb profiling support. You can also
try using <a href="{@docRoot}tools/help/traceview.html">Traceview</a> to profile your application. If your application is running too slow, this can help you 
find the bottlenecks and fix them.</p>

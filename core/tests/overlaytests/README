Unit tests for runtime resource overlay
=======================================

As of this writing, runtime resource overlay is only triggered for
/system/framework/framework-res.apk. Because of this, installation of
overlay packages require the Android platform be rebooted. However, the
regular unit tests (triggered via development/testrunner/runtest.py)
cannot handle reboots. As a workaround, this directory contains a shell
script which will trigger the tests in a non-standard way.

Once runtime resource overlay may be applied to applications, the tests
in this directory should be moved to core/tests/coretests. Also, by
applying runtime resource overlay to a dedicated test application, the
test cases would not need to assume default values for non-overlaid
resources.

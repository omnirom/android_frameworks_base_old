<p>Provides classes that manage Bluetooth functionality, such as scanning for
devices, connecting with devices, and managing data transfer between devices.
The Bluetooth API supports both "Classic Bluetooth" and Bluetooth Low Energy.</p>

<p>For more information about Classic Bluetooth, see the
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth.html">Bluetooth</a> guide.
For more information about Bluetooth Low Energy, see the
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth-le.html">
Bluetooth Low Energy</a> guide.</p>
{@more}

<p>The Bluetooth APIs let applications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scan for other Bluetooth devices (including Bluetooth Low Energy
    devices)</li>
  <li>Query the local Bluetooth adapter for paired Bluetooth devices</li>
  <li>Establish RFCOMM channels/sockets</li>
  <li>Connect to specified sockets on other devices</li>
  <li>Transfer data to and from other devices</li>
</ul>

<p>
To perform Bluetooth communication using these APIs, an application must
declare the {@link android.Manifest.permission#BLUETOOTH} permission. Some
additional functionality, such as requesting device discovery,
also requires the {@link android.Manifest.permission#BLUETOOTH_ADMIN}
permission.
</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
Not all Android-powered devices provide Bluetooth functionality.</p>

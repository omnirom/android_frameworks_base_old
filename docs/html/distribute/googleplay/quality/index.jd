<p>App quality directly influences the long-term success of your app&mdash;in
terms of installs, user rating and reviews, engagement, and user retention.
Android users expect high-quality apps, even more so if they've spent money on
them. At the same time, users enjoy and value apps that put a priority on
continuous improvement. </p>

your app meets the basic quality expectations of users, across all of the form
factors and device types that the app is targeting. The documents in this
section help you assess your app's fundamental quality and address any
issues that you find. </p>

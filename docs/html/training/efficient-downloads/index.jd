<p>In this class you will learn to minimize the battery life impact of downloads and network connections, particularly in relation to the wireless radio.</P

<p>This class demonstrates the best practices for scheduling and executing downloads using techniques such as caching, polling, and prefetching. You will learn how the power-use profile of the wireless radio can affect your choices on when, what, and how to transfer data in order to minimize impact on battery life.</p> 

<h2>Lessons</h2> 
 
<!-- Create a list of the lessons in this class along with a short description of each lesson.
These should be short and to the point. It should be clear from reading the summary whether someone

<dl> 
  <dt><b><a href="efficient-network-access.html">Optimizing Downloads for Efficient Network Access</a></b></dt>
    <dd>This lesson introduces the wireless radio state machine, explains how your appâ€™s connectivity model interacts with it, and how you can minimize your data connection and use prefetching and bundling to minimize the battery drain associated with your data transfers.</dd>
 
  <dt><b><a href="regular_updates.html">Minimizing the Effect of Regular Updates</a></b></dt>
    <dd>This lesson will examine how your refresh frequency can be varied to best mitigate the effect of background updates on the underlying wireless radio state machine.</dd>

  <dt><b><a href="redundant_redundant.html">Redundant Downloads are Redundant</a></b></dt>
    <dd>The most fundamental way to reduce your downloads is to download only what you need. This lesson introduces some best practices to eliminate redundant downloads.</dd>

  <dt><b><a href="connectivity_patterns.html">Modifying your Download Patterns Based on the Connectivity Type</a></b></dt>
    <dd>When it comes to impact on battery life, not all connection types are created equal. Not only does the Wi-Fi radio use significantly less battery than its wireless radio counterparts, but the radios used in different wireless radio technologies have different battery implications.</dd>

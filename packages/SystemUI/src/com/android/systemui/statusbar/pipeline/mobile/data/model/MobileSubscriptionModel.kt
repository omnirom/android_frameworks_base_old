 * a Subscription in the telephony world. These models are the result of a single telephony listener
 * which has many callbacks which each modify some particular field on this object.
 *
 * The design goal here is to de-normalize fields from the system into our model fields below. So
 * any new field that needs to be tracked should be copied into this data class rather than
 * threading complex system objects through the pipeline.

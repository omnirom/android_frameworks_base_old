<p>Besides enabling communication with the cloud, Android's wireless APIs also
enable communication with other devices on the same local network, and even
devices which are not on a network, but are physically nearby.  The addition of
Network Service Discovery (NSD) takes this further by allowing an application to
seek out a nearby device running services with which it can communicate.
Integrating this functionality into your application helps you provide a wide range
of features, such as playing games with users in the same room, pulling
images from a networked NSD-enabled webcam, or remotely logging into
other machines on the same network.</p>
<p>This class describes the key APIs for finding and
connecting to other devices from your application.  Specifically, it
describes the NSD API for discovering available services and the Wi-Fi
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) API for doing peer-to-peer wireless connections.  This class also
shows you how to use NSD and Wi-Fi P2P in
combination to detect the services offered by a device and connect to the
device when neither device is connected to a network.

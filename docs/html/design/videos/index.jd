    <p>In the Android UX team, it is critical to get user feedback frequently and consistently so that we are able to iterate and develop the best-in-class designs for our users. We will discuss how the team applied "Pulse Studies" (iterative research sessions) in order to put new ideas, designs, and concepts in front of users on a regular basis; it requires minimal advance planning, it can have an immediate product impact, and it can meet urgent needs. </p>

    <p>An app is useless if people can't find their way around it. Android introduced big navigation-support changes in 3.0 and 4.0. The Action Bar offers a convenient control for Up navigation, the Back key's behavior became more consistent within tasks, and the Recent Tasks UI got an overhaul. In this talk, we discuss how and why we got where we are today, how to think about navigation when designing your app's user experience, and how to write apps that offer effortless navigation in multiple Android versions.</p>

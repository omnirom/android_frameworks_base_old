      Animations can add subtle visual cues that notify users about what's going on in your app and
      improve their mental model of your app's interface. Animations are especially useful when the
      screen changes state, such as when content loads or new actions become available. Animations
      can also add a polished look to your app, which gives your app a higher quality feel.

      Keep in mind though, that overusing animations or using them at the wrong time can be
      detrimental, such as when they cause delays. This training class shows you how to
      implement some common types of animations that can increase usability and add flair without
      annoying your users.

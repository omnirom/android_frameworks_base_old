<p>
  Google Play policies prohibit spam, to help ensure the best experience for
  Android users. Please do not publish deceptive, repetitive, or irrelevant
  content on Google Play. Not only will it lower your app's rating and cause
  negative reviews, it can result in your app being suspended or your developer
  account terminated.
</p>

<p>
  As an app developer, it is your responsibility to ensure that your apps are
  free from spam and conform to the Google Play policies highlighted in this
  document. Before you publish, make sure that you understand what is
  considered spam on Google Play and check your apps for violations, even those
  that might be inadvertent. The sections below highlight best practices and
  common spam examples to help you avoid the most common types of policy
  violations.
</p>

<p>
  For more information about Google Play policies that apply to your apps and
  content, please see the <a href=
  "http://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html" target=

<h2 id="keyword-spam">Spam in App Title and Description</h2>

<p>
  When you publish an app on Google Play, you should pay special attention to
  the app's title and description in its store listing. Those fields are
  important because they make your app recognizable to users, and they help to
  drive downloads by highlighting what's great about your app. A memorable
  title and compelling description are essential to effective marketing, but
  you should realize that these must follow Google Play policies, just as your
  app content must do.
</p>

<p>
  Many developers unknowingly violate spam policy in their app titles and
  descriptions in ways that are easy to avoid. In general, you can
  avoid spam violations in your app title and description by following these
  best practices:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Highlight what's great about your app</strong>&mdash;Share
    interesting and exciting facts about your app with users. Help users
    understand what makes your app special.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Describe your app accurately</strong>&mdash;Make sure the title
    and description describe the app function and user experience accurately.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Don't use repetitive keywords</strong>&mdash;Avoid keywords that
    are repetitive or excessive.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Don't include unrelated keywords or references</strong> &mdash;
    Your description should not be loaded with irrelevant keywords in an
    attempt to manipulate ranking or relevancy.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Keep it brief</strong>&mdash;Keep the description succinct and
    straightforward. Shorter descriptions tend to give a better user experience
    on devices with smaller displays. Excessive length, detail, or repetition
    can violate spam policy.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Here's an example app title and description that follows best practices and
  does not violate Google Play spam policies.
</p>

<div class="example-block good" style="width:100%;float:none;margin:.5em auto 2em 0;">

      <p>This is the perfect app to have a good time with your children. It
        is designed to help kids learn different species of turtles through
        cute pictures and amusing puzzle games.</p>
      <p>The rules of Kids puzzle: Identify Turtles are quite simple. Have
        your child drag images around the screen to fit them into the shaded
        region. Phonics is also utilized, as a child can also tap the word
        below the image and hear the name pronounced.</p>

  The sections below highlight common types of policy violations in an app
  title and description, illustrated with variations on the best practice
  example. 
</p>

<h3 id="repetitive-keywords">Repetitive keywords</h3>

<p>
  Your app description should not include keywords that are repetitive or excessive.
</p>

<div class="example-block bad" style="width:100%;float:none;margin:.5em auto 2em 0;">
  <div class="heading">Description includes repetitive keywords</div>

    </td>
  </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<h3 id="unrelated-keywords">Unrelated keywords or references</h3>

<p>
  The description should not be loaded with irrelevant keywords in an attempt
  to manipulate ranking or relevancy in Google Play search results.
</p>

<p>
  For example, if your app has nothing to do with Lady Gaga, then she shouldn’t
  be included in your description. Also, do not add highly searched, irrelevant
  keywords that are unrelated to the function of the app. This is in breach of
  policy.
</p>

<h3 id="excessive-detail">Excessive detail, references to your other apps</h3>

<p>
  Your app description should avoid excessive detail and references to your
  other apps or products. For example, you should not list all of the details
  of content included in the app or its various components, as shown in the
  example below. Also, the description should not include any references to
  other apps you’ve published.
</p>

<h2 id="ratings">Spam in Ratings and Reviews</h2>

<div class="example-block bad" style="width:440px;">
  <div class="heading">Inappropriate content in a review</div>
  <img src="{@docRoot}images/gp-policy-spam-negreview.png">
</div>

<p>
  Ratings and reviews are benchmarks of app quality and users depend on them to
  be authentic and relevant. As an app developer, you should not attempt to
  artificially influence your app's ratings and reviews or those of your
  competitor, such as by posting fake ratings or reviews or including spam
  content in app reviews. The sections below provide guidelines for rating and
  reviewing apps.
</p>

<p>
  So that you can stay in touch with any issues that users are having with your
  app, you should read through your ratings and reviews on a regular basis. If
  you choose to reply to reviews, make sure to keep your reply focused on the
  actual issues raised in the user's comments and do not ask for a higher
  rating.
</p>

<p>
  If you see an app or developer reply that doesn’t follow these guidelines,
  you can report it. See <a href=

  more information.

  <img src="{@docRoot}images/gp-policy-spam-reqrating.png">
</div>

<h3 id="fake-ratings">Fake or inappropriate ratings and reviews</h3>

<p>
  To help ensure the quality of ratings and reviews, Google Play policies limit
  the ways that individuals can use ratings and reviews. In particular, note
  that it is a violation of policy to use ratings and reviews to influence the
  placement of any app in Google Play.
</p>

<p>
  As an app developer, make sure that you follow these guidelines:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Don't try to manipulate ratings</strong>&mdash;Do not engage in
    attempts to manipulate the ratings, reviews, or ranking of your apps,
    either directly or indirectly, or by manipulating the ratings of your
    competitors. Do not attempt to artificially boost reviews, ratings, or
    installs through any means.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Don't solicit ratings through incentives</strong>&mdash;Do not
    offer users any incentives to rate your app, such as offering rewards of
    any kind or tying app functionality to rating.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Don't rate apps multiple times</strong>&mdash;Do not review or
    rate any app multiple times in an attempt to influence its placement in
    Google Play.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Don't add improper content to reviews</strong>&mdash;Do not
    include affiliate, coupon, game codes, email addresses, or links to
    websites or other apps in your reviews. If you are responding to a user
    review, feel free to include references to helpful resources such as a
    support address or FAQ page.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="solicited-ratings">Soliciting ratings from users</h3>

<p>
  In general, <strong>do not offer incentives for ratings</strong>. You should
  not offer users incentives of any kind for rating your app (or any other app)
  on Google Play, and you should not tie your app's functionality or content to
  rating in any way.
</p>

<p>
  It's acceptable to ask users to rate your app without incentives, for
  example: "If you like this game, rate us in Google Play!" On the other hand,
  it's a policy violation to ask users to rate your app based on incentives,
  for example: "Rate this app and get 500 coins" or "Rate this app 5 stars and
  get you 500 coins!"
</p>


<h2 id="webview-spam" style="clear:right">Spam in WebViews</h2>

<p>
  Apps published on Google Play should provide their own content. Do not
  publish an app whose primary function is to reproduce or frame someone else’s
  website (unless you have permission).
</p>

<p>
  Similarly, do not publish an app whose primary function is to drive affiliate
  traffic to a website. Although affiliate deals can exist where an app's
  primary purpose is delivering its own content or functionality, it's a
  violation of Google Play policies to publish an app whose primary (or
  only) purpose is to direct affiliate traffic to another website.

<h2 id="wizard-spam">Spam from Wizards</h2>

<p>
  Apps that are created by an automated tool or wizard service must not be
  submitted to Google Play by the operator of that service on behalf of other
  persons. Such tools often produce too many duplicative or low-quality
  apps which crowd the higher-quality apps in the Play Store.
</p>

<p>
  Please be advised that apps created by an automated tool are only permissible
  if the app end-product complies with Google Play policies and is published in
  the Play Store through a developer account that is registered and owned by
  you.
</p>


<h2 id="message-spam">Spam in Messaging</h2>

<p>
  Your app may not send SMS, email, or other messages on behalf of the user
  without providing the user with the ability to confirm the content and intended
  recipient.
</p>

<p>
  Google Play will aggressively remove applications that are found to send or
  modify SMS messages without user knowledge or consent.
</p>

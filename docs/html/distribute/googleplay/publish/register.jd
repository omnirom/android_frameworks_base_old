<h2>Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You need a Google account to register. You can create one during the process. </li>
    <li>If you are an organization, consider registering a new Google account rather than using a personal account.</li>
    <li>Review the <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=138294">developer countries</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=150324">merchant countries</a> where you can distribute and sell apps.</li> 
  </ul>
</div></div>


<ol>
<li>Visit the Google Play Developer Console at <a
href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/">https://play.google.com/apps/publish/</a>.
<li>Enter basic information about your <strong>developer identity</strong> &mdash; developer
name, email address, and so on. You can modify this information later.</li>
<li>Read and accept the <strong>Developer Distribution Agreement</strong> that applies to your
country or region. Note that apps and store listings that you publish on Google Play must comply
with the Developer Program Policies and US export law,</li>
<li>Pay a <strong>$25 USD registration fee</strong> using Google Wallet. If you don't have
a Google Wallet account, you can quickly set one up during the process.</li>
</ol>

<p>When your registration is verified, youâ€™ll be notified at the email address you specified during registration.</p>

<h3>Set up a Google Wallet Merchant account</h3>
 
<p>If you want to sell products on Google Play &mdash; priced apps, in-app products, or subscriptions &mdash; you will also need to set up a Google Wallet Merchant Account. You can do that at any time, but make sure to first review the list of <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=150324">merchant countries</a>.</p>

<p>To set up a Merchant account from the Developer Console:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Sign in</strong> to your Google Play Developer Console at
<a href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/">https://play.google.com/apps/publish/</a>
<li>Open <strong>Financial reports</strong> <img src="{@docRoot}images/distribute/console-reports.png"
  style="vertical-align:baseline;margin:0"> on the side navigation.
<li>Click <strong>Setup a Merchant Account now</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>This takes you to the Google Wallet site to sign up as a Merchant;
you'll need information about your business available to complete this step.</p>

<h3>Explore the Developer Console</h3>
<p>When your registration is verified, you can sign in to your Developer Console, which will be the home for your app publishing operations and tools on Google Play. </p>

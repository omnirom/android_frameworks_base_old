<p>Introducing Google Play for Education, the online destination where schools
can find the right tablet content and tools for their students and teachers.</p>

<p>With easy bulk ordering for groups, schools will be able to purchase and
instantly distribute apps, videos, and books right to their studentsâ€™
devices.</p>

<p>The Google Play team looks forward to seeing you create first class content
that will help schools. We want to help you create innovative educational apps,
without having to knock on school doors to reach teachers and students.</p>

<h4>Get discovered</h4>

<p>With Google Play for Education, teachers and administrators will be able to
browse content by curriculum, grade, and standard &mdash; discovering the right
content at the right time for their students. If your app offers an exciting new
way to learn sixth grade algebra, we'll make it easy for math educators to find,
purchase, and distribute your app to their classes.</p>

<h4>Reach more schools and students</h4>

<p>Google has built a strong network of K-12 schools who are already using
Google Apps for Education and other Google services. These schools are excited
and looking forward to bringing your apps and content into their classrooms with
Nexus tablets.</p>

<h4>Monetize effectively</h4>
<p>With the wide launch of Google Play for Education later this year, educators
will be able to make high-volume purchases using standard institutional payment
mechanisms and distribute them to the students they want &mdash; whether it is a
class of 30 or a district of 30,000.</p>

    <h4>Android tablets in the classroom</h4>
    <p>Google Play for Education brings the innovation of Android technology
into classrooms. Educators can set up and deploy large numbers of devices in
just minutes or hours rather than days.</p>

    <h4>Curriculum-based discovery</h4>
    <p>Powerful browsing tools let educators quickly discover apps, books,
videos, and other content&mdash;with many recommended by teachers and
categorized according to familiar Core Curriculum standards.  

    <h4>Bulk purchase with institutional payment</h4>
    <p>Convenient purchasing and delivery tools let educators buy apps in bulk
using purchase orders and other payment methods that are easy for schools to
manage.</p>

    <h4>Over-the-air delivery to student devices</h4>

      <p>After finding apps they want to use, educators can push them instantly
to student devices over the air. They can send the apps to individuals or groups
of any size, across classrooms, schools, or even districts. </p>

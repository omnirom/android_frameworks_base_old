Contains the SQLite database management
classes that an application would use to manage its own private database.
<p>
Applications use these classes to manage private databases. If creating a
content provider, you will probably have to use these classes to create and
manage your own database to store content. See <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html">Content Providers</a> to learn
the conventions for implementing a content provider. See the
NotePadProvider class in the NotePad sample application in the SDK for an
example of a content provider. Android ships with SQLite version 3.4.0
<p>If you are working with data sent to you by a provider, you will not use
these SQLite classes, but instead use the generic {@link android.database}
classes.
<p>Android ships with the sqlite3 database tool in the <code>tools/</code>
folder. You can use this tool to browse or run SQL commands on the device. Run by
typing <code>sqlite3</code> in a shell window.

      "message": "I think this is where Horrible Things happen if the packageIDs are the same between an overlay and its target.  (Need to recheck a logcat, it may be elsewhere, see below...)\n\nBefore this patch, I believe this code would effectively cause the criteria here to get ignored if the package was an overlay as it would only be executed if idmapIndex was \u003c 0, which happens if there are no idmapEntries for this item.  After the patch, things are different.",

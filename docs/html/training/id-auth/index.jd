<p>Android users get attached to their devices and to applications that they
love. One way to make your application lovable is to make it personal. Android
devices know who your user is, what services they have access to, and where they
store your data. With your user's permission, you can use that information to
make your application a richer, more personal experience.</p>

<p>In this class, you will learn multiple techniques for interacting with your
user's identity, enabling you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Personalize your app by remembering users by their account name(s)
<li>Authenticate the user to make sure they are who they say they are
<li>Gain permission to access the user's online data via services like
the Google APIs
<li>Add a custom account to the user's device to authenticate your own
back-end services
</ul>

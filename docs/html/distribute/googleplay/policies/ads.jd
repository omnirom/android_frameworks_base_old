<p>
  Google Play policies guide how you can use ads in your apps, to help ensure
  the best experience for users visiting and downloading apps from the store.
</p>

<p>
  In general, for the purposes of policy, the content of ads displayed by your
  app is considered part of your app. As an app developer, it is your
  responsibility to ensure that the content, context, and behavior of ads in
  your apps conforms to Google Play policies.
</p>

<p>
  Before you publish, make sure you understand Google Play ad policies and how
  to display ads in conformance with those policies. The sections below
  highlight best practices and common examples to help you avoid the most
  common types of policy violations.
</p>

<p>
  For more information about Google Play policies that apply to your apps and
  content, please see the <a href=
  "http://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html" target=
  "_policies">Developer Program Policies</a> and <a href=
  "http://play.google.com/about/developer-distribution-agreement.html" target=
  "_policies">Developer Distribution Agreement</a>.

<h2 id="content-maturity">Content and Maturity</h2>

<div class="example-block bad">
  <div class="heading">Ad maturity exceeds app</div>
  <img src="{@docRoot}images/gp-policy-ads-maturity-violation.png">
</div>

<p>
  From a policy perspective, ads shown in your app are part of your content
  and your app is responsible for any violations. If an ad shown in your app
  violates Google Play policies, your app may be suspended or your developer
  account terminated.
</p>

<p>
  For this reason, it's important for you to be be aware of what ads will be
  displayed in your app and to manage the ads content according to Google Play
  policies. Here are some guidelines:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Ads must not violate Content Policy</strong>&mdash;Ads in
        your app must not violate the terms of Google Play’s Content Policy,
        including those concerning illegal activities, violence, sexually
        explicit content, or privacy violations.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Ads maturity must be consistent with your app's
        maturity</strong>&mdash;Content shown in your ads must be consistent
        with the app’s maturity rating in Google Play. Especially, ads content
        should never exceed your app's maturity rating, even if the ads content
        by itself complies with general policies.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In the example at right, the app's maturity rating is set to
  "Everyone", which is the lowest maturity level on Google Play. By choosing
  the "Everyone" maturity level, the developer is declaring that all of the
  content in the app, <em>including ads</em>, is suitable for all users
  regardless of age.
</p>

<p>
  The example app violates Google Play policies by displaying ad content with a
  higher maturity level&mdash;ad content showing gambling, profanity, user
  location, suggestive content, or content from another app with higher
  maturity exceeds the "Everyone" maturity rating. Because the ad's
  maturity is higher than the app's maturity level, the app itself is in
  violation of policy. To correct the problem, the developer must either
  restrict ads content to "Everyone" level or raise the app's maturity rating.
</p>

<p>
  For detailed information about how to choose the appropriate maturity level
  for your app, or to assess the maturity requirement of ads in your app, see

<h2 id="context">Context and Behavior</h2>

<p>
  If your app displays ads, it should do so in ways that do not interrupt users,
  mislead them into clicking on ads, or make changes outside the app without
  the user's knowledge or consent. Here are some guidelines:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Display your ads within your UI</strong>&mdash;If possible,
    display ads only within your app's UI. This leads to a better user
    experience and helps avoid policy violations
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Don't make changes outside of the app without consent</strong>
   &mdash;Ads must not make changes outside of the app without the user's
    full knowledge and consent.
  </li>

  <li>
  <div class="example-block bad" style="width:360px;margin:1em 0 0 2em;">
    <div class="heading">Ads through system-level notifications</div>
    <img src="{@docRoot}images/gp-policy-ads-notif-attr-violation.png">
  </div>
  <div class="example-block good" style="width:360px;margin:.5em 0 0 2em;">
    <div class="heading">Notification that's part of the app's feature set</div>
    <img src="{@docRoot}images/gp-policy-ads-notif-attr.png">
  </div>
    <strong>Changes outside the app must be reversible</strong>&mdash;If an
    ad makes changes outside the app as described above, the changes (and
    origin app) must be evident and easily reversible. For example, the user
    must be able to locate and reverse the changes by adjusting settings,
    changing ad preferences in the app, or uninstalling the app altogether.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Notification ads are prohibited</strong>&mdash;Your app
    should not create system-level <a href=
    "{@docRoot}design/patterns/notifications.html">notifications</a>
    containing ads unless the notifications are part of the explicit
    feature set of the app.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Don't add shortcuts, bookmarks, or icons</strong>&mdash;Your app
    and its ads must not add homescreen shortcuts, browser bookmarks, or icons
    on the user's device as a service to third parties or for advertising 
    purposes.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Above right is an example notification ad that violates ad policy by
  providing ads through system level notification.
</p>
<p>
  Below right, the notification ad complies with policy because the
  nature of the notification is part of the explicit feature set of the app,
  and it also provides attribution of the origin app. 
</p>

<h2 id="disclosure" style="clear:right">Disclosure of Ads to Users</h2>

<p>
  It's important to sufficiently disclose to users how your app will use ads.
  You must make it easy for users to understand what ads will be shown in your
  app, where they will be shown, and what the associated behaviors are, if any.
  Further, you should ask for user consent and provide options for managing ads
  or opt-out. Here are some guidelines:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Tell users about your ads</strong>&mdash;Create a simple,
    complete disclosure that tells users how your app uses ads, where the ads
    are shown, and how they can manage ad options. Take common-sense steps to
    make the disclosure as clear as possible.
  </li>

  <li>
    <div class="example-block good" style="width:213px;margin-left:.5em;">
      <div class="heading">Disclosure in Terms</div>
      <img src="{@docRoot}images/gp-policy-ads-terms.png">
    </div>
    <div class="example-block bad" style="width:213px;">
      <div class="heading">Disclosure is hidden</div>
      <img src="{@docRoot}images/gp-policy-ads-eula-violation.png">
    </div>
    <strong>Make sure users know</strong>&mdash;Present your ads disclosure
    is an easy-to-see location, rather than hiding it where users are not
    likely to find it.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Ask for consent (opt-in) at launch</strong>&mdash;Where possible,
    include your ads disclosure in the app description as well as in an Ads
    Terms, End User License Agreement (EULA), or similar document. Display the
    terms at first launch and ask for the user's consent before continuing to
    the app.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  A recommended approach is to provide an ads disclosure in an End-User License
  Agreement (EULA). The disclosure should be clear and succinct and displayed
  in a modal dialog that asks the user to agree to the terms before using the
  app.
</p>

<p>
  Above left is an example of ads disclosure that is hidden in a long EULA. The
  disclosure information itself is not clearly indicated in the document text
  and it's not visible unless the user happens to scroll down far enough in the
  EULA. 
</p>
<p>
  Above right shows an approach that presents the disclosure in an obvious
  and clear manner in a EULA and a dedicated Terms agreement. 
</p>


<h2 id="impersonation">Impersonation of System UI</h2>








<p>
  Ads must not simulate or impersonate the user interface of any app, or
  notification and warning elements of an operating system. Your app must not
  display any ad that attempts to impersonate or represent a
  system function or UI component. If such an ad is displayed in your app, your
  app will be in violation of policy and subject to suspension. Here are some
  guidelines:
</p>

<ul>  
  <li>
    <strong>No fake app UI notifications</strong>&mdash;Ads should not impersonate
    the interface of an application for advertising purposes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>No fake system dialogs or warnings</strong>&mdash;Any ad that
    presents itself as a system dialog or warning and asks for user input is in
    violation of Google Play policies.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>No fake app updates</strong>&mdash;Ads should not impersonate
    system UI for app updates.
  </li>
</ul>

<p style="clear:both">
  Above are examples of impersonations &mdash; a pop-up ad that impersonates a
  system dialog, an ad that impersonates a system warning, and an ad that impersonates
  an application UI. All of these are in violation of policy.
</p>


<h2 id="adwalls">Adwalls and Interstitial Ads</h2>

<p>
  If your app uses adwalls to drive affiliate traffic, those adwalls must not
  force the user to click on ads or submit personal information for advertising
  purposes before using the app.
</p>

<p>
  Forcing a user action in an adwall is not only a poor user experience, it is
  a violation of Google Play policies.
</p>

<p>
  For this reason, <strong>all adwalls must give the user the option to
  cancel</strong> or otherwise dismiss the ad without penalty. Interstitial ads
  may only be displayed inside of the app they came with. Forcing the user to
  click on ads or submit personal information for advertising purposes in order
  to fully use an app is prohibited.
</p>

<div class="example-block bad" style="width:213px;">
  <div class="heading">Interstitial, modal ad</div>

<p style="clear:both">
  At left is an example of an app that requires the user to click through the
  ad to fully use the app. This is a violation of policy.
</p>

<p>
  The center example demonstrates an adequate option to let the user dismiss
  the ad wall easily by cancelling. This is not a violation of policy.
</p>

<p>
  At right is an example of an interstitial, modal ad that is displayed outside
  of the app. This is a violation of policy.
</p>

<h2 id="interfering" style="clear:right;">Interfering with Apps and Third-Party Ads</h2>

<p>
  Ads associated with your app <strong>must not interfere</strong> with other
  apps or their ads.
</p>

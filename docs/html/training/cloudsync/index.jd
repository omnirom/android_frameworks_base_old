<p>By providing powerful APIs for internet connectivity, the Android framework
helps you build rich cloud-enabled apps that sync their data to a remote web
service, making sure all your devices always stay in sync, and your valuable
data is always backed up to the cloud.</p>

<p>This class covers different strategies for cloud enabled applications.  It
covers syncing data with the cloud using your own back-end web application, and
backing up data using the cloud so that users can restore their data when
installing your application on a new device.

@jd:body

<p>The In-app Billing API is versioned, with each version offering additional features to your app. API support is provided by the Google Play Store app. On most devices, the Google Play Store app is updated automatically to support newer versions of the API. 

<p>The sections below list the supported versions of the In-app Billing API.</p>

<p id="api_check"><strong><em>How to check for In-app Billing version</em></strong></p>

<p>At run time, your app can query the Google Play Store app to determine what version of the API it supports and what features are available. </p>

<ul>
<li>If you are using in-app  billing version 3, the version information is not directly returned the Google Play. Instead, you can check if Google Play supports the version of the In-app Billing API that you are using by sending a {@code isBillingSupported} request.</li>
<li>If the In-app Billing API version that you are using is earlier than version 3, the version information is returned in the <code>API_VERSION</code> key of the Bundle object passed in the {@code sendBillingRequest} method. For more information, see <a href="{@docRoot}google/play/billing/v2/billing_reference.html#billing-interface-v2">In-app Billing Service Interface</a>.</li>

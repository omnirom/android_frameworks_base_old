     In the Automotive case, this is helpful if there's a requirement for an UI element to be on
     screen at all times. Setting this to true also gives System UI the ability to override the
     visibility controls for the system through the usage of the
     "SYSTEM_BAR_VISIBILITY_OVERRIDE" setting.
     Ex: Only setting the config to true will force show system bars for the entire system.
     Ex: Setting the config to true and the "SYSTEM_BAR_VISIBILITY_OVERRIDE" setting to
     "immersive.status=apps" will force show navigation bar for all apps and force hide status
     bar for all apps. -->

         This allows for specifying whether or not system bars can be shown by the user (via swipe

         This is useful for cases where the system provides alternative affordances for showing and
         hiding the bars or for cases in which it's desired the bars not be shown for any reason.

page.title=Setting Up the ADT Bundle

@jd:body


<p>The ADT Bundle provides everything you need to start developing apps, including
a version of the Eclipse IDE with built-in <b>ADT (Android Developer Tools)</b> to
streamline your Android app development.
If you haven't already, go download the <a href="{@docRoot}sdk/index.html"
>Android ADT Bundle</a>. (If you downloaded the SDK Tools only, for use with an
existing IDE, you should instead read
<a href="{@docRoot}sdk/installing/index.html">Setting Up an Existing IDE</a>.)</p>

<h3>Install the SDK and Eclipse IDE</h3>
<ol>
<li>Unpack the ZIP file
(named {@code adt-bundle-&lt;os_platform>.zip}) and save it to an appropriate location,
such as a "Development" directory in your home directory.</li>
<li>Open the {@code adt-bundle-&lt;os_platform>/eclipse/} directory and launch
<strong>eclipse</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it! The IDE is already loaded with the Android Developer Tools plugin and
the SDK is ready to go. To start developing, read <a href="{@docRoot}training/basics/firstapp/index.html"
>Building Your First App</a>.</p>

<p class="caution"><strong>Caution:</strong> Do not move any of the files or directories
from the {@code adt-bundle-&lt;os_platform>} directory. If you move the {@code eclipse}
or {@code sdk} directory, ADT will not be able to locate the SDK and you'll
need to manually update the ADT preferences.</p>

<h3>Additional information</h3>

<p>As you continue developing apps, you may need to install additional versions
of Android for the emulator and other packages such as the library for
Google Play In-app Billing. To install more packages, use
the <a href="{@docRoot}tools/help/sdk-manager.html">SDK Manager</a>.</p>

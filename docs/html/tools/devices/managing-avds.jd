  <p>The AVD Manager is an easy to use user interface to manage your AVD (Android Virtual Device)
  configurations. An AVD is a device configuration for the Android emulator that allows you to
  model different configurations of Android-powered devices. When you start the AVD Manager in Eclipse 
  or navigate to your SDK's {@code tools/} directory and execute
  <code>android avd</code>. You will see the AVD Manager as shown in
  figure 1.</p>

  <p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 1. </strong>Screenshot of the AVD Manager. </p>
  
  <p>From the main screen, you can create, delete, repair and start AVDs as well as see the details
  of each AVD. </p>

  
  <h2 id="createavd">Creating an AVD</h2>

  <p>You can create as many AVDs as you would like to test on. It is recommended that you test your
  applications on all API levels higher than the target API level for your application.</p>

  <p>To create an AVD:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Start the AVD Manager:

      <ul>
        <li>In Eclipse: select <strong>Window &gt; AVD Manager</strong>, or click
        the AVD Manager icon in the Eclipse toolbar.</li>

        <li>In other IDEs: Navigate to your SDK's <code>tools/</code> directory and execute the
        <code>android</code> tool with no arguments.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><p>In the <em>Virtual Devices</em> panel, you'll see a list of existing AVDs. Click
    <strong>New</strong> to create a new AVD. The <strong>Create New AVD</strong> dialog appears.</p>
      
      <img src="{@docRoot}images/developing/avd-dialog.png" alt="AVD Dialog">
      <p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Screenshot of the Create AVD window</p>
    </li>

    <li>Fill in the details for the AVD.

      <p>Give it a name, a platform target, an SD card size, and a skin (HVGA is default). You can
      also add specific hardware features of the emulated device by clicking the
      <strong>New...</strong> button and selecting the feature. For a list of hardware features,
      see <a href="#hardwareopts">Hardware options</a>.</p>

      <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to define a target for your AVD that satisfies
      your application's Build Target (the AVD platform target must have an API Level equal to or
      greater than the API Level that your application compiles against).</p>
    </li>

    <li>Click <strong>Create AVD</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Your AVD is now ready and you can either close the AVD Manager, create more AVDs, or
  launch an emulator with the AVD by selecting a device and clicking <strong>Start</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="hardwareopts">Hardware options</h3>
<p>If you are creating a new AVD, you can specify the following hardware options for the AVD
to emulate:</p>

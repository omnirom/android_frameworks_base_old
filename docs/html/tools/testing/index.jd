<p> The Android framework includes an integrated testing framework that helps you test all aspects
of your application and the SDK tools include tools for setting up and running test applications.
Whether you are working in Eclipse with ADT or working from the command line, the SDK tools help you
set up and run your tests within an emulator or the device you are targeting. </p>

<p>If you aren't yet familiar with the Android testing framework, start by reading <a
href="{@docRoot}tools/testing/testing_android.html">Testing Fundamentals</a>. For a step-by-step
introduction to Android testing, try the <a

      <h4>New Gingerbread API: StrictMode</h4>
      <p>StrictMode is a new API in Gingerbread which primarily lets you set a policy on a thread
declaring what you’re not allowed to do on that thread, and what the penalty is if you violate the
policy. Implementation-wise, this policy is simply a thread-local integer bitmask.</p>

      <h4>Traceview War Story</h4>
      <p>I recently took my first serious look at Traceview, and it occurred to me, first, that
there are probably a few other Android developers who haven’t used it and, second, that this is an
opportunity to lecture sternly on one of my favorite subjects: performance improvement and
profiling.</p>

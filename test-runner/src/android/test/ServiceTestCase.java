/**
 * This test case provides a framework in which you can test Service classes in
 * a controlled environment.  It provides basic support for the lifecycle of a
 * Service, and hooks with which you can inject various dependencies and control
 * the environment in which your Service is tested.
 *
 * <div class="special reference">
 * <h3>Developer Guides</h3>
 * <p>For more information about application testing, read the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/testing/index.html">Testing</a> developer guide.</p>
 * </div>
 *
 * <p><b>Lifecycle Support.</b>
 * A Service is accessed with a specific sequence of
 * calls, as described in the
 * <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals/services.html">Services</a>
 * document. In order to support the lifecycle of a Service,
 * <code>ServiceTestCase</code> enforces this protocol:
 *
 * <ul>
 *      <li>
 *          The {@link #setUp()} method is called before each test method. The base implementation
 *          gets the system context. If you override <code>setUp()</code>, you must call
 *          <code>super.setUp()</code> as the first statement in your override.
 *      </li>
 *      <li>
 *          The test case waits to call {@link android.app.Service#onCreate()} until one of your
 *          test methods calls {@link #startService} or {@link #bindService}.  This gives you an
 *          opportunity to set up or adjust any additional framework or test logic before you test
 *          the running service.
 *      </li>
 *      <li>
 *          When one of your test methods calls {@link #startService ServiceTestCase.startService()}
 *          or {@link #bindService  ServiceTestCase.bindService()}, the test case calls
 *          {@link android.app.Service#onCreate() Service.onCreate()} and then calls either
 *          {@link android.app.Service#startService(Intent) Service.startService(Intent)} or
 *          {@link android.app.Service#bindService(Intent, ServiceConnection, int)
 *          Service.bindService(Intent, ServiceConnection, int)}, as appropriate. It also stores
 *          values needed to track and support the lifecycle.
 *      </li>
 *      <li>
 *          After each test method finishes, the test case calls the {@link #tearDown} method. This
 *          method stops and destroys the service with the appropriate calls, depending on how the
 *          service was started. If you override <code>tearDown()</code>, your must call the
 *          <code>super.tearDown()</code> as the last statement in your override.
 *      </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 *      <strong>Dependency Injection.</strong>
 *      A service has two inherent dependencies, its {@link android.content.Context Context} and its
 *      associated {@link android.app.Application Application}. The ServiceTestCase framework
 *      allows you to inject modified, mock, or isolated replacements for these dependencies, and
 *      thus perform unit tests with controlled dependencies in an isolated environment.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *      By default, the test case is injected with a full system context and a generic
 *      {@link android.test.mock.MockApplication MockApplication} object. You can inject
 *      alternatives to either of these by invoking
 *      {@link AndroidTestCase#setContext(Context) setContext()} or
 *      {@link #setApplication setApplication()}.  You must do this <em>before</em> calling
 *      startService() or bindService().  The test framework provides a
 *      number of alternatives for Context, including
 *      {@link android.test.mock.MockContext MockContext},
 *      {@link android.test.RenamingDelegatingContext RenamingDelegatingContext},
 *      {@link android.content.ContextWrapper ContextWrapper}, and
 *      {@link android.test.IsolatedContext}.
